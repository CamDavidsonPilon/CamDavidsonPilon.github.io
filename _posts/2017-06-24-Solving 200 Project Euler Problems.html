<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Last week, I achieved a goal of hitting 200 problems solved in Project Euler. If you are unfamiliar with <a href="http://www.projecteuler.net" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="project euler">Project Euler</a>, it's a website where users can solve tricky problems that require both mathematics and programming to solve. An example question:</p>
<meta charset="utf-8"/>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">Having three black objects B and one white object W they can be grouped in 7 ways like this:</div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
<table align="center" cellpadding="10" height="47" style="margin-left: 30px;" width="620">
<tbody style="padding-left: 30px;">
<tr style="padding-left: 30px;">
<td style="padding-left: 30px; width: 53px;">(BBBW)</td>
<td style="padding-left: 30px; width: 57px;">(B,BBW)</td>
<td style="padding-left: 30px; width: 61px;">(B,B,BW)</td>
<td style="padding-left: 30px; width: 65px;">(B,B,B,W)</td>
</tr>
<tr style="padding-left: 30px;">
<td style="padding-left: 30px; width: 53px;">
<div><meta charset="utf-8"/></div>
(B,BB,W)</td>
<td style="padding-left: 30px; width: 57px;">
<div><meta charset="utf-8"/></div>
(BBB,W)</td>
<td style="padding-left: 30px; width: 61px;">
<div><meta charset="utf-8"/></div>
(BB,BW)</td>
<td style="padding-left: 30px; width: 65px;"></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;"></div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">In how many ways can <strong>sixty</strong> black objects B and <strong>forty</strong> white objects W be thus grouped?</div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;"></div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;"></div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;"></div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;"></div>
<div>This a)<meta charset="utf-8"/>has no closed for formula (hence needs programming to run computations) and b) <meta charset="utf-8"/>can't be done by simple for loops (hence needs math to find shortcuts). In this blog post, I'll talk about my experience solving 200 problems. </div>

<h3>What did I learn?</h3>
<div>Looking back, it's really impressive the amount of new things I learned. I don't have either a number theory background or computer science background, so a lot of topics were novel to me (too many to list!). Some of the topics I really enjoyed learning about were generating functions, heaps, Pell's equation, factoring combinations, and dynamic programming. My favourite problems were probability problems (my background) and dynamic programming.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>I did everything in Python, and feel like a much stronger Python developer. I'm pretty sure I used each function in `itertools` at least once, and thought a lot about efficient implementations in Python. </div>

<h3>Progress</h3>
<p>I started in Jan. 2016, and was able to collect my progress of completion over time: </p>

<p>There is also the concept of the the "difficulty" of a problem, provided by the website itself as a measure of how often participants get the answer wrong. Here is the cumulative difficulty:</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I'm not finished with Project Euler yet - there are <em>way</em> to many problems I spent time on but didn't solve and they are just itching me. However, I am taking a break for a while so I can focus on some other projects. After all, solving 200 problems was <em>technically</em> my lifetime goal. </p>
<p>If a person asked me "is Project Euler worth the time?" - I wouldn't immediately say yes. You do need lots of time, and it really is a personal thing (there is a leaderboard, but it's not nearly as public as, say, StackOverflow's leaderboards). You also need to think about the opportunity cost - will solving these problems further your career or research? Personally, I feel that Project Euler rounded out my understanding of computer science and mathematics, and not so heavily loaded on statistics and Python applied to statistics. </p>

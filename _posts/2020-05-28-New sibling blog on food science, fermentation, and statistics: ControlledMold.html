<p>I've started a new blog at <a href="https://controlledmold.com/">ControlledMold</a> that is more about the food, fermentation and cell-ag side of my research. There are still data science and statistics articles, too, like <a href="https://controlledmold.com/measuring-cell-growth-using-a-secchi-stick-and-lots-of-fun-math/">Using a Secchi Stick to Measure Cell Density</a>. Enjoy! </p>

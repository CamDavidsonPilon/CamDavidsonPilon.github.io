<p>Last November, I was lucky enough to give the keynote at PyCon Canada 2015. Below is the abstract and video for it: </p>
<meta charset="utf-8"/>
<blockquote>
<p><span>Python developers are commonly using Python as a tool to explore datasets - but what if we reverse that analysis lens back on to the developer? In this talk, Cam will use Python as a data analysis tool to explore Python developers and code. With millions of data points, mostly scraped from Github and Stackoverflow, we'll reexamine who the Python developer is, and how Python developers write code.</span> </p>

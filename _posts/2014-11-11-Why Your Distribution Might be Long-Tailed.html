<p>I really like this below video explaining how a long-tailed distribution (also called powerlaw distributions, or fat-tailed distributions) can form naturally. In fact, I keep thinking about it and applying it to some statistical thinking. Long-tailed distributions are incredibly common in the social science: for example, we encounter them in</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.2;">the wealth distribution: few people control most of the wealth.</span></li>
<li>
<span style="line-height: 1.2;">social networks: celebrities have thousands of times more </span><em style="line-height: 1.2;">followers</em><span style="line-height: 1.2;"> than the median user.</span>
</li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.2;">revenue generated by businesses: Amazon is larger than the next dozen internet retailers combined </span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.2;">book sales: most books have less than a thousand sales, but a handful of books have millions of sales.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>I've enumerated only four, but there are many others. Below is a video explaining one reason why we see powerlaw distributions.</p>

<p>I really like this video because it gives a very intuitive reason why powerlaws <em>can </em>exist. It also cements that the <em>winners become </em><em>winners </em>scheme will create powerlaws and extreme inequalities. </p>
<p>It's tempting to go in reverse: given you see a powerlaw, the distribution must have been generated by a <em>winners become </em><em>winners</em> scheme. Unfortunately, this is not true: there are other schemes that can create powerlaws. <em> </em>But I would go as far as to say that <em>most</em> empirical powerlaws we see are generated by <em>winners become </em><em>winners. </em>The trick is to find out why <em>winners become </em><em>winners. </em></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Duration as a Powerlaw</h2>
<p>The above gives a good generating scheme of how powerlaws arise for quantities (books sales, wealth, followers), but what about durations?  There exist durations that are powerlawed: response times in server requests are powerlawed, ages of technologies are powerlawed. The generating scheme <em>winners become </em><em>winners </em>doesn't carry over well to the time domain. Is there an analogy we can use? </p>
<p>Update: Françoise P., in the comments, offers an interesting solution. Packet arrival time in networks often follow a powerlaw. There is another case, similar to this. Consider a random walk over the integers, starting at 0 and with a 0.5 chance of moving up one, and a 0.5 chance of moving down one. The distribution of the duration between returning to 0 is powerlawed: the probability of a duration of length n is proportional to one over 2 to the power of n. </p>

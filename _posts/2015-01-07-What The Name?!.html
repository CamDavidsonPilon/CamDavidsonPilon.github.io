<p><a href="http://littlesnippets.ca/">Kylea Parker</a> and I over the holidays put together our first ever infographic! Now, her having a design background and myself having a stats background, we set out to do all infographics right: correct statistics and beautiful communication through design. I believe we achieved that.  </p>
